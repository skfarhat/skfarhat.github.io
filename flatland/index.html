 One of the shorter books I have a read, a mere 100 pages were enough to fascinate me and reaffirm my long-standing belief about how little we know about the world.
The book is entitled Flatland because it narrates the story of a square living in a 2D world. By 2D world, you can go ahead and imagine a flat white sheet of paper on which a square is drawn - yes that is our main character."/>

<p>One of the shorter books I have a read, a mere 100 pages were enough to fascinate me and reaffirm my long-standing belief about how little we know about the world.</p>
<p>The book is entitled Flatland because it narrates the story of a square living in a 2D world. By 2D world, you can go ahead and imagine a flat white sheet of paper on which a square is drawn - yes that is our main character. The square lives in a society where all citizens are 2D shapes: lines, triangles, squares, pentagons, hexagons (and all the &lsquo;gons&rsquo;) and circles.</p>
<p>The first part of the book details the life of shapes in Flatland, their laws, behaviours, social conventions, communication methods and overall lifestyle. This kind of introduction was well-needed as it places the reader in the correct frame of mind to understand how a 2D world would differ from the world as we know it, in 3D.</p>
<p>The second part of the book is where the action starts. The Square has an unfamiliar dream where it can see many straight lines and points all moving in a straight singular direction - that appears to be the world of Lineland. The Square starts to talk to the longest line it could see, which incidentally turns out to be the King of Lineland, who cannot see the Square. This due to the fact that the Square had not stood in the king&rsquo;s field (line) of vision. But once it did, the King could only see a point. The Square attempted to explain to the King that there was a world beyond 1D, a world called 2D where people could move in 4 directions instead of 2, a world with angles and all. The King uncomprehensive became unnerved and began to make threats. It wasn&rsquo;t much later that the Square woke up from its dream&hellip;</p>
<p>Later on, the Square was visited by what seemed to be a circle that could grow in radius. In reality, it was a Sphere that was crossing Flatland. The Sphere in turn tried its utmost to explain the existence of another dimension (the 3rd),
but the Sphere would not comprehend. After exhaustive trials, the Sphere forcefully removed the Square from Flatland and took it to Spaceland, where the Square became astonished with what it could see.</p>
<p><strong>This part I liked the most&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>Having seen and learned to much, the Square began to do some mathematical reasoning and rightfully induced that there should be another higher dimensional world (4D). The Sphere, however, did not take this well and completely rejected the possibility mainly because it couldn&rsquo;t grasp it. At this point in reading, I rested my book and tried to conceive a 4-dimensional world and failed of course.</p>
<p><strong>The book&rsquo;s strongest point I believe is:</strong></p>
<p>When reading, you feel put in the shoes of the shape trying to explain a concept to another. None of the characters accepted an idea they <strong>didn&rsquo;t</strong> understand or <strong>couldn&rsquo;t</strong> understand, be it the King of Lineland trying to digest the concept of 2D, or the Square understanding 3D, or even the Sphere when pushed to consider the existence of 4D.</p>
