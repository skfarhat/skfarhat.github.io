The criticism seemed repetitive at times and would have profited from being more abridged, still the influx of new economic knowledge - especially for someone without such a background - was appreciable and pleasing."/>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The book is logically split into two parts.</p>
<p><strong>Chapters 1-7</strong>: The author examines the various forms of money and its properties. They then review the economic systems and money standards employed throughout history, as well as the impact each that had on societies and their productivity.
The author spends a fair bit of this part criticising Keynes and his economics which currently remain widely taught in academia. The criticism seemed repetitive at times and would have profited from being more abridged, still
the influx of new economic knowledge - especially for someone without such a background - was appreciable and pleasing.</p>
<p><strong>Chapters 8-10</strong>: In this part, the author introduces Bitcoin and discusses the motivation behind its creation; they detail its fixed supply rate and the  technology underlying its functioning - blockchain - and how the technology obviates the need for trusted third-parties overlooking transactions.
The author did well to discuss money in general and the productivity of various economies in the earlier part, as that adequately laid the groundwork for the discussion in this part on Bitcoin&rsquo;s contribution to current economies.</p>
<p>One contentious point of the author&rsquo;s is that blockchain technology is only applicable in digital-cash systems and has no role to play in other industries and no other use-cases.
Personally, I disagree.
Sure, many of the altcoins created a few years back did not provide grand utility and were quick ways to raise capital from hasty investors. But since then, billions have been poured in to the sector with the aim of researching and improving blockchain to further many industries and solve long-existing problems.</p>
<h2 id="retained-info">Retained info</h2>
<p>🔑 By creating blockchain, Nakamoto made <strong>digital scarcity</strong> possible: bytes of data can now be owned by a single entity and only transferred to another but not copied! No two people can have the same bytes.
In everyday speak, I might say &ldquo;I will send you the files&rdquo;, but what I mean is &ldquo;I will make a copy the files and send you the copy&rdquo;. The insurance that bits of data can now only be transferred and not copied is digital scarcity and why blockchain is revolutionary.</p>
<p>🕐 Blocks on the blockchain are not issued precisely every 10 minutes because the difficulty adjustment algorithm can overshoot or undershoot in its estimates.</p>

<h2 id="-history-and-dates">📅 History and Dates</h2>
<p><strong>1717:</strong> Britain was the first to adopt the gold standard under Issac Newton who was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_the_Mint">Master of the Mint</a>. Is there anything this man hasn&rsquo;t done!?</p>
<p><strong>1918:</strong> WW1 would have ended much earlier had the participating remained on the gold standard as they would have run out of resources sooner without the ability to effectively print money.</p>
<p><strong>1920:</strong> There was another depression much less publicised and studied.</p>
<p><strong>1929:</strong> Year the Great Depression started</p>
<p><strong>2140:</strong> Year during which the supply of Bitcoin will cease.</p>
