  The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous is an enjoyable and insightful read on the economics of Bitcoin and the impact the cryptocurrency can have on world economies.
  I would certainly recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about Bitcoin.

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The book is logically split into two parts.</p>

<p><strong>Chapters 1-7</strong>: The author examines the various forms of money and its properties. They then review the economic systems and money standards employed throughout history, as well as the impact each that had on societies and their productivity.
The author spends a fair bit of this part criticising Keynes and his economics which currently remain widely taught in academia. The criticism seemed repetitive at times and would have profited from being more abridged, still
the influx of new economic knowledge - especially for someone without such a background - was appreciable and pleasing.</p>

<p><strong>Chapters 8-10</strong>: In this part, the author introduces Bitcoin and discusses the motivation behind its creation; they detail its fixed supply rate and the  technology underlying its functioning - blockchain - and how the technology obviates the need for trusted third-parties overlooking transactions.
The author did well to discuss money in general and the productivity of various economies in the earlier part, as that adequately laid the groundwork for the discussion in this part on Bitcoin&rsquo;s contribution to current economies.</p>

<p>One contentious point of the author&rsquo;s is that blockchain technology is only applicable in digital-cash systems and has no role to play in other industries and no other use-cases.
Personally, I disagree.
Sure, many of the altcoins created a few years back did not provide grand utility and were quick ways to raise capital from hasty investors. But since then, billions have been poured in to the sector with the aim of researching and improving blockchain to further many industries and solve long-existing problems.</p>

<h2 id="retained-info">Retained info</h2>

<p>🔑 By creating blockchain, Nakamoto made <strong>digital scarcity</strong> possible: bytes of data can now be owned by a single entity and only transferred to another but not copied! No two people can have the same bytes.
In everyday speak, I might say &ldquo;I will send you the files&rdquo;, but what I mean is &ldquo;I will make a copy the files and send you the copy&rdquo;. The insurance that bits of data can now only be transferred and not copied is digital scarcity and why blockchain is revolutionary.</p>

<p>🕐 Blocks on the blockchain are not issued precisely every 10 minutes because the difficulty adjustment algorithm can overshoot or undershoot in its estimates.</p>

<p>💵 Money&rsquo;s important properties:
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
  <li> ⚖️ Saleability across scales: it is divisible </li>
  <li> ⏳ Saleability across time: it maintains value </li>
  <li> 🚀 Saleability across space: it is easily transportable </li>
</ul>
<!-- TODO: provide a nice talk through of the different available moneys and we end up with gold --></p>

<p>⚱️ Why gold is a great store of value:
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
  <li> 📈 High stock-to-flow ratio: gold cannot be created from other elements and has to be mined, which is expensive in itself. Also, no matter how much gold is mined, the added stock remains far lower than existing stock. </li>
  <li> ⛏ It cannot be destroyed, it has saleability in time. Unlike say copper, which, if used as store of value would erode over time and take that value to the soil with it. </li>
  <li> 💎 Gold has value in the jewellery and other industries, in contrast to Bitcoin which only has a monetary role. Because of its chemical properties and aesthetic uses, gold is in high-demand in the jewellery industry and others. Were its price to suddenly drop for some reason, these industries will pounce on the opportunity to buy more for their applications which will lead to its price rising again and stabilising. </li>
</ul></p>

<h2 id="history-and-dates">📅 History and Dates</h2>

<p><strong>1717:</strong> Britain was the first to adopt the gold standard under Issac Newton who was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_the_Mint">Master of the Mint</a>. Is there anything this man hasn&rsquo;t done!?</p>

<p><strong>1918:</strong> WW1 would have ended much earlier had the participating remained on the gold standard as they would have run out of resources sooner without the ability to effectively print money.</p>

<p><strong>1920:</strong> There was another depression much less publicised and studied.</p>

<p><strong>1929:</strong> Year the Great Depression started</p>

<p><strong>2140:</strong> Year during which the supply of Bitcoin will cease.</p>

<!-- * Gold standard: when it went bye bye  -->

<!-- * Ammous really doesn't like Keynes and his economics. Much prefers Austrian economics. I need to spend more time understanding the differences between the two.  -->

<!-- Expand upon -->

<!-- * How important it is that we do not know who Nakamoto is; it prevents Bitcoin from being centralised around or influenced by its creator.   -->

<!-- * Breton Woods - Treaty of Genoa -->

<h2 id="next-books-on-the-horizon">Next books on the horizon</h2>

<p>📒 A book on blockchain, Bitcoin or Ethereum; most likely a book on Ethereum.</p>

<p>📕 <strong>The richest man in Babylon</strong> - George S. Clason: Read this one about 10 years ago, but I&rsquo;d like to refresh my memory. Also, it&rsquo;s just a hundred or so pages.</p>

<p>📗 <strong>Wealth of Nations</strong> - Adam Smith: heard that&rsquo;s a tough read, might still give it a go.</p>

<p>📘 <strong>21 lessons for the 21st Century</strong> - Yuval Noah Harari: Read Sapiens and loved it, also I would like some lessons for the century I live in.</p>

<p>📙 <strong>Le Petit Prince</strong>: Read it when I was about 10 y.o, and I&rsquo;m looking to sharpen up my French again. Would be an nice and easy introductory read.</p>
